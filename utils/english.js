In conjunction with this partnership, a joint venture called Sustainable Development and Investment Company (SDIC) S.A.O.C has been established to carry out the execution of this phase.
        <br>
        <br>
        “OMRAN Group’s partnership with Diamond Developers marks a major milestone in Yiti Development as we together begin the first phase of this integrated urban destination in Muscat. The signing further attests to OMRAN Group’s strategic vision in expanding the nation’s tourism sector and continuing to play a pivotal role as a catalyst and enabler of multi-fold, lucrative investment opportunities in the country in line with Oman Investment Authority’s directions in realising the ambitious goals of Oman Vision 2040 and supporting the delivery of the National Tourism Strategy,” said Hashil Bin Obaid Al Mahrouqi, CEO of OMRAN Group.

        title: "Diamond Developers announce the launch of ‘The Sustainable City – Yiti’ with an investment value of nearly one billion US dollars",
        discription: `Earning a commendable reputation for being the leading developers of sustainable communities in the UAE, Diamond Developers in partnership with the Oman Tourism Development Company (OMRAN Group), announced the launch of ‘The Sustainable City – Yiti’ in Muscat, today.
