It will feature a ‘SEE lab’ which will showcase the latest in sustainability solutions like renewable energy technologies, indoor vertical farming, and humidity harvesting. With an innovative carbon natural building, the ‘SEE Institute’ will, additionally, focus on promoting awareness on environmental issues and sustainable living. <br><br>Striking the right balance between sustainability goals and promoting wellness, the city will feature a number of sports facilities which include jogging and cycling tracks, an equestrian club, and a horse track. It will also include a plaza that hosts a selection of commercial outlets, like shops, restaurants, and cafes. <br><br>In an endeavor to support eco-tourism, the project will feature a four-star neighborhood hotel with 197 rooms, a five-star resort with 170 rooms and a range of restaurants, numerous leisure facilities, and beachfront access. The resort will also manage 132 luxury serviced apartments to further accommodate the diverse needs of visitors. <br><br>The Sustainable City- Yiti positions itself as a working model for future cities that meets the highest sustainability standards.
